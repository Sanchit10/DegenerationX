PDP Assignment 6
My thoughts -

It would be extremely helpful if you go through section 11.2  from lecture 11. I have implemented the builder class
as a nested inner class, because the lecture encouraged us to do so. Also the 'freecellmodel' class should
consists of the number of cascade and open piles we need because they can vary.
The card class looks complete and we only need to put in a getter method for rank which should take a minute
For the startgame , you need to check if the deck that is being passed is valid or not.
